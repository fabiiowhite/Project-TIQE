# Project-TIQE ⚡
A project serving as practice for the implementation of 1 idea into multiple programming languages. 🚀		 
		
### What is the “tiqe” project?		
		
The word “tiqe” comes from the word “xitique”. In this project, the security of the amounts of money collected must be the main priority, as well as their fair distribution. The essence of this project is the variety of implementations of a single idea, consisting of programming it using different programming languages ​​(Python, Java, Flutter, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and much more).	
		
		
### Why “tiqe”?		
		
“tiqe” is a project with the purpose of support in savings (informal and collective), in which the members of a certain group (generally made up of friends, colleagues or relatives) contribute periodically with a predefined monetary value, so that each one receives , in turn, the set of contributions collected in this way.	


This will be an ongoing project, with lots of updates due to continuous learning and application of new in-demand programming languages. ✌️
